            I'm a brand designer based in Madrid, born in Venezuela, with Portuguese heritage. I currently work at a creative agency, and occasionally take on freelance projects that spark creative interest and strategic challenge. My work centers on building meaningful brand identities by combining strategy, design systems, and visual storytelling. I'm especially passionate about concept-driven design that's clear, consistent, and emotionally engaging.
